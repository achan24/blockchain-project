Creation of a Decentralized, web3 enabled application


Overview  
For This Assignment you must develop a Web3 Enabled, decentralized application.
The application will require a login functionality (Web3) and must have at least 3 elements of Functionality. 

The Student must work to ensure the Application is working as designed with no errors in functionality and/or operation. 

Examples of Functionality include: 
	The use of Web3 wallet for Login functionality 
	The connection of the Application with an underlying deployed Smart Contract  
	The Sending and receiving of funds, the function of which is available through the application
	The use of external or third-party APIs for Function and Design of the Application
Additional Functionality is expected to be implemented by the student furthering the above functions. 


The application should be visually designed to be suitable for the below assigned domain :

•	Student Number: 1-2 : Finance
•	Student Number: 3-4 : Retail 
•	Student Number : 5-6 : Marketing
•	Student Number : 7-8 : Sports
•	Student Number : 9-0 : Health 



1.	 Students are required to develop a Decentralized application which is considered as a Web3 enabled Application

2.	The Application must communicate with an underlying smart contract deployed on the Sepolia	 test network or suitable Ethereum Test Network 

3.	The Application must have a front end in which the user can interact with the application and therefore the underlying smart contract. 

4.	The application must have functionality as dictated above. 

5.	The application can be cloud hosted or delivered locally. 

6.	Additional Points awarded for Cloud Deployment of the application; points awarded shown in rubric below. 

7.	The Application must have a login functionality through the use of Web3 login with Metamask. 

 
Your Decentralized Application must be accompanied by a brief report and presentation 

The report must be no longer than 6 pages, including the DApp report and a separate 1 page report on the use of smart contracts in industry with examples of the state of the art.  

The presentation must be max 7 mins and cover the key areas of functionality of the application, you must show the applications features and functionality. 

Your report must include an original architectural diagram of your own design which shows components of the application and the overall relationship between the tools and components used.
Examples of Architectural Diagrams are found on your moodle page.   

Justification for the design and functionality of the DApp must be given and explained within the report.
